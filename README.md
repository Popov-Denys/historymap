This app is not production ready, it is missing things such as setting
headers and session control. 

# Style: 
I have written in semi-standard and using double spacing (standard with semi-colons).

I use "cammelCase" for variable names. 

It's good policy to have a style guide for the project.

# Build tools used: 
## Grunt -task runner: 
Concatenates and minfies code. 

Move to the /nodeServer folder and start it via command line: 

`grunt watch`

Note that (on my system Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS) this only works for node version <14 and not the
latest versions. 

This is only need in development.
